Documentation: Steps for Creating an Assume Role in AWS
Steps in Creating Assume Role:
1. Ensure AWS CLI is Configured
Before starting, verify that the AWS CLI is installed and configured on your system. This ensures you have the necessary access to manage AWS resources.

2. Create Terraform Files
Create PROVIDER.tf: This file will specify the provider configuration.
Create user.tf: In this file, you will create the IAM user first and then enable the Access Key ID. Optionally, you can also add an iam_user_login_profile to enable console access.
3. Create role.tf
In the role.tf file:

Include the IAM policy that grants full access to S3.
Create an IAM role and attach the defined policy to this role.
4. Create output.tf
In the output.tf file:

Define outputs to retrieve the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key necessary for CLI access.
Include the ARN of the role to be assumed. Ensure that the sensitive attribute is set to true for the Secret Access Key to protect sensitive information.
5. Handling Sensitive Information
After executing the Terraform configuration, the Secret Access Key will not be displayed directly in the terminal. Instead, it will be shown as secret-key = <sensitive>. To view the secret key, you can use the command:
	terraform output -json 
This will allow you to see all outputs, including the sensitive ones.

6. Use the Retrieved Credentials

Now you have all the necessary IDs to assume the role:
1. Configure AWS CLI: Log in to AWS CLI using the user created with Terraform.
	aws configure
2. Assume the Role: Use the following command to assume the role and retrieve temporary credentials:
	aws sts assume-role --role-arn "arn:of:the:role" --role-session-name "any_name"
    This command will display temporary credentials.
3. Set Environment Variables: Export the retrieved credentials to your environment variables:
	set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<access_key_id>
	set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<secret_access_key>
	set AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=<session_token>
By following these steps, you will successfully create an IAM user, configure the role, and assume that role using temporary credentials.
